# Visual-Studio-Painters

This code works out the total cost for painting 4 walls, and extra costs include the undercoat and the type of paint the users want.

It firsts asks for the users name and their email address. It then asks for the ISBN number, which then works out if the ISBN number is valid.
Then, the users can input the 4 different lengths of the walls in the textbox, and the height of the walls. It works out the area of all these walls and adds them together, and the user can choose the type of paint they want out of Luxury, Standard or Economy, and can select undercoat if they want it.

Undercoat would cost an extra £0.50 per square metre, and Luxury paint would cost £1.75 per metre, Standard would cot £1.00 per metre and Eonomy would cost £0.45 per metre.

The total cost is worked out by using the total area * the chosen paint, and the undercost if selected
